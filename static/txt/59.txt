"I would like to apologize for my unacceptable behavior in my fight against David Price," Ali said in a statement on April 3.

"I am sorry to all boxing fans, to my team, my family, the British Boxing Board, David Price, his team and his family.

"I am hugely embarrassed for my actions and the way the whole fight unfolded. The occasion got the better of me and those who know me including David can testify that my behavior on Saturday during the fight was not a true reflection of who I am."
