Real Madrid took the quarantine decision after one of the club's basketball players tested positive for coronavirus.

"We have initiated the recommendations to start a quarantine for both the basketball team and the football team, given that the two teams share facilities in the Training Center," a Real Madrid statement said.

"We have also decided to close the facilities of our training center and we recommended that all Real Madrid personnel who work in the training center quarantine themselves."

Following the Real Madrid decision, La Liga organizers confirmed in a statement on Thursday that all matches in Spain's top and second division will be suspended for the next two matchdays. 

La Liga said it will "revaluate" the situation following the completion of quarantine "mandated by the affected clubs and other possible situations that could arise."

"Considering the circumstances known this morning, referring to the quarantine established by Real Madrid and the possible positives of players in other clubs, La Liga considers that the threshold has been met to follow through with the next phase of the protocol against COVID-19," a La Liga statement said. 

The league added that it had notified the clubs, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and the national sports ministry of the postponements.
