Vettel was deemed to have rejoined the circuit in an unsafe manner after making a mistake during lap 48, pushing rival Lewis Hamilton off the track in the process. 

Despite holding off the Mercedes driver for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line in front, the time penalty ensured Vettel finished second.

"At the moment, we, as a team, are naturally disappointed, but most of all our thoughts are with Sebastian and the spectators," said Ferrari Team Principal Mattia Binotto.

"As for Seb [Vettel], I don't think he could have done things differently, which is why we have decided to appeal the stewards' decision."

Vettel strop

The German driver staged a mini protest after the race, initially refusing to take to the podium and swapping the number one and two boards that had been placed in front of the Mercedes and Ferrari cars.

"I think we had a great race and the stewards' decision is too harsh," said Vettel, after the race.

"In turn 3, I lost control of my car and I had to run long onto the grass, rejoining at turn 4 ahead of Lewis. I couldn't see where he was, as I was too busy trying to keep my car on track without crashing and I didn't squeeze him on purpose.

"I think given the way things went this weekend and even though our rivals' race pace was very strong, we deserved the win, and I get the impression that lots of the spectators here today at the circuit agree with me."

Social reaction

However, Vettel's reaction after the race was ridiculed by some on social media, with many likening his antics to a childish strop. 

"EXACTLY what my daughter Flo would do if she didn't get her own way. She's 6," said former F1 presenter Jake Humphrey.

Meanwhile, others were sympathetic to the German and questioned the stewards' decision. 

"Any of the stewards ever raced at the front in F1? Didn't watch the race.. have now seen the 'incident'. Mental penalty," tweeted former F1 driver Mark Webber.

Hamilton wins again

Amid all the controversy, Hamilton secured his fifth win of the season and maintained his team's 100% record. The Briton leads the drivers' standings with 162 points, with Valtteri Bottas second on 133 and Vettel third on 100.

After the race, the Briton defended the decision to punish his rival: "Ultimately the rules say when you go off you have to come back on in a safe manner and I was alongside and I had to back off to avoid a collision and I guess that's why they made the decision."
