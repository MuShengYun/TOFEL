Williams, who was also fined $17,00 for her remarks towards the umpire in last September's US Open final, has dropped just one set in her opening four matches.

She beat Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2 6-2 Monday to set up an All-American quarter final with Alison Riske, who upset world No.1 Ashleigh Barty.

The 37-year-old Williams is targeting a first Wimbledon title since 2016 and a record-equaling 24th grand slam victory.

Of the four players left in William's half of the draw, they collectively have 31 major final appearances between them -- but unfortunately for her opponents, Serena has all 31 of them.
