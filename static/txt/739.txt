Federer eyes US Open 

Despite the loss, Federer said he was pleased to have come through the Cincinnati Masters injury free and has already turned his attention to the US Open later this month.

The world No. 3 is looking to clinch his sixth title at Flushing Meadows, his first since 2008. 

"I worked very hard coming into Cincinnati and in that little season we had since Wimbledon, so I can maybe also utilize a couple of days off," the 38-year-old added.

"I'm going to train, do exactly what I need to do for the US Open and that's it. It's fairly simple, but I've got to work hard."

'Most emotional win'

Meanwhile, Rublev will be looking to build on an impressive breakthrough year which has now seen him beat two top-five players -- the other being world No. 4 Dominic Thiem.

The world. No 70 was clearly emotional after beating Federer and can now look forward to a quarterfinal match up with fellow Russian Daniil Medvedev.

"It's the biggest and most emotional win," said Rublev, before turning his attention to praising Federer.

"I can't imagine every day how much pressure you have. I mean, to know that you're Roger and everybody is watching you and you need to prove it every day, and he's doing this, I don't know for how many years. I mean, this is something, I don't know, unreal."
