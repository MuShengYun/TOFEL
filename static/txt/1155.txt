At a meeting of ruling party officials, the North Korean leader also said his country's long term security will be guaranteed by staying on constant alert and relying on "the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US," according to the Korean Central News Agency.

KCNA released the report at the end of "The 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea." In the plenary, Kim said "the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the US rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built." 

In an indication that North Korea could soon resume nuclear weapon testing, Kim said his country should no longer feel bound by its self-imposed halt on nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing. He also announced that "the world will witness a new strategic weapon" in the near future, KCNA reported.

Later Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters he was still optimistic about the future of diplomacy -- despite Kim's new rhetoric. Touting his relationship with Kim, Trump said he believed the North Korean leader was a "man of his word."

"He likes me, I like him, we get along," he said. "He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News earlier Tuesday that he hoped Kim "doesn't go in that direction" and instead will "choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war."

The US is "hopeful" that Kim "will make the right decision," he said, also telling CBS Evening News that "if Chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to President Trump, that is deeply disappointing." 

"We've lived up to our commitments, we continue to hold out hope that he'll live up to his as well," Pompeo said.

Kim was expected to give his annual New Year's speech on Wednesday -- a highly anticipated address as he had said he would only give the United States until the end of 2019 to change its negotiating strategy.

But at the time of reporting, the speech had not gone ahead. Kim had given a New Year's speech ever year since 2013, and traditionally used the address to make major announcements, update his people on a handful of government policies, and chart a direction for the country in the coming months.

A 'Christmas gift' to the US

Kim's latest threats come as American officials closely monitor North Korea following its promise in December to deliver a "Christmas gift" to the US. 

The specific language -- North Korea referred to its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch in 2017 as a "gift" -- sparked speculation that Pyongyang could do something equally provocative, though the holiday came and went without any weapons test.
