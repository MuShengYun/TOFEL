With the hosts struggling to find a way past a stubborn defense, the club captain stepped up to send the Etihad Stadium into a frenzy with a stunning shot from distance with just 20 minutes left on the clock. 

With his side now just one win away being crowned champions, the goal promises to be yet another iconic moment in this incredible title race. 

Pep Guardiola's team can secure its consecutive title, at the expense of Liverpool, if it wins against Brighton on Sunday.

An emotional Kompany demonstrated just how important the goal was after a nervy night in Manchester.

The Citizens were frustrated for much of the match by an impressive Leicester side which managed to snub out the host's impressive array of attacking talent. 

However, when the game looked to be heading toward a goalless draw, Kompany sent a missile into the top corner. 

"I hadn't scored this season but I always feel in big moments that I'm going to do something, I don't know if it's a header or what," Kompany told Sky Sports after the game.

"Today was a little bit of frustration, everyone was saying 'don't shoot, don't shoot' and I could really hear it. I thought hold on a second, I've not come this far in my career for young players to tell me if I can take a shot, and I just had a go!".

Time and time again Kompany has stepped up to inspire Manchester City to victory in big games. He must now be considered as one of Manchester City's greatest ever players. 

His strike secured Manchester City's 13th consecutive victory in the league and was its 100th goal at home this season.

Nervy night

Having had eight days to rest since its last match -- a narrow win over Burnley -- Manchester City started the game at a typical high tempo but it was an intensity matched by its visitors.  

Leicester City has been rejuvenated under new manager Brendan Rodgers -- winning five out of nine games since the former Liverpool manager replaced Claude Puel in February -- and looked sharp during the early stages of the match. 

However, just as the home crowd began to grow restless, Sergio Aguero reminded everyone of his team's infinite attacking talent as he almost gave his side the lead. 

The Argentine powered his way to the front post to meet a corner with a flicked header that rebounded off the woodwork, before goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel cleared off the line. 

Goal-line technology, which had awarded the hosts the winning goal in its last game, showed just how fine the margins are in this season's title race. 

Despite a sustained period of pressure from Manchester City, an entertaining first-half ended goalless giving hope to Liverpool fans across the globe. 

The second-half started in a similar vein, with the hosts dominating but failing to get the better of a resolute Leicester back line.

In search of the breakthrough, Guardiola rolled the dice and sent on Leroy Sane as part of a front four which initiated an all-out assault on the Leicester goal. 

Aguero once again came agonizingly close before Kompany defied the odds with one of the moments of the season.

Down to the wire

The result sets up a mouth-watering prospect for the last day of the season, with Manchester City just one point ahead of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool. 

The Reds must win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and hope Manchester City drop points away at Brighton.

Such has been the form of both teams this season, the side that finishes second will have amassed the most points of any runner-up in Premier League history.

 "We are in the last game and it is in our hands. We are going to prepare well," Guardiola told BBC Sport after the match.

"We'll see if Brighton defend deep or will be more offensive. It will be tough, but hopefully we will have the performance to be champions."
