The pair are the latest of a host of tennis stars to donate to the cause after Australian Nick Kyrgios kick-started a wave of support from the sport earlier this week.

Wildfires have raged across Australia for months, killing 24 people and burning about 14.7 million acres of bushland.

Naval and air rescue operations were launched on Friday as mass evacuations of towns at risk of being engulfed by flames got underway. 

"The month of January in Australia has been my home for the past 15 years," Sharapova wrote on Twitter.

"Watching the fires destroy the lands, its beautiful families and communities of animals is deeply (heartbreaking). 

"I would like to begin my donation at 25K. @DjokerNole, would you match my donation?"

The defending Australian Open champion replied on Monday offering his support: "Yes, @MariaSharapova I would like to match your $25k donation to double the aid sent to these communities," Djokovic wrote on Twitter. "We stand by you, #Australia."

Five-time grand slam champion Sharapova will compete in the Brisbane International which starts on Monday, while world No. 2 Djokovic has been competing for Serbia at the ATP Cup ahead of the Australian Open. 

Ashleigh Barty, the top seed in Brisbane, will donate her winnings at the tournament to the Australian Red Cross bushfire appeal.

The Australian, who won her first grand slam title at the French Open last year, had already donated $20,850 ($30,000 AUSD) to the RSPCA to support wildlife affected by the fires at the end of last year, and would donate a further $265,500 ($382,000 AUSD) were she to win in Brisbane.

"Wildlife has been lost but it has also affected lives and homes so I have been sitting down and thinking with my team and family on ways we can help," Barty told reporters on Sunday.

"There have been really great initiatives from cricketers, tennis players, golfers, soccer players all over the country trying to help out."
