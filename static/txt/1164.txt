Chelsea was heading for victory in the New Year's Day encounter at the Amex Stadium when Jahanbakhsh met a loose ball from a corner with an overhead kick which left visiting keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with no chance.

The stunning 84th minute equalizer was no more than Brighton deserved from a spirited display after falling behind to an early goal for Cesar Azpilicueta.

It was the second goal in two games for second half substitute Jahanbakhsh, who had gone over 18 months without scoring since becoming Brighton's record signing from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar, and one that will linger long in the memory.

"It was the best goal of my career," he told BT Sport.

"I had a feeling I would make an impact in this game and when the ball came to me I tried as hard as possible to kick it and the only option for me was a bicycle kick," he added.

The draw has lifted Brighton further clear of the drop zone ahead of later New Year's Day fixtures, with Chelsea staying in the fourth and final Champions League spot with manager Frank Lampard frustrated after seeing his side's early dominance wasted.

"In the first half, the game was there to be won. We weren't ruthless enough," he told BT Sport.  "We got the goal and we had the possession. But we just didn't kill the game off."

Villa cheer

The other early kick off saw Aston Villa move out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 victory at Burnley with captain Jack Grealish outstanding.

He had an opening effort chalked off controversially by VAR before striker Wesley put the visitor ahead in the 27th minute.

Grealish then struck just before the break with a fine strike that found the top corner.

Burnley improved after the interval and Chris Wood pulled one back with 10 minutes left, Villa holding on for a vital three points.

"To come here, one of the hardest places in the league, it was well-deserved and well-needed," Grealish told BBC Sport.

Leicester stays second

In later kick offs, Leicester City stayed in second place, 10 points behind runaway leader Liverpool, with a 3-0 win at Newcastle, the home side ending the match with 10 men after a string of injuries.

Former Newcastle man Ayoze Perez put the Foxes ahead nine minutes before break, his fifth goal since leaving for Leicester in the summer.

Midfield star James Maddison doubled Leicester's lead before the interval with a fine strike and there was no way back for Steve Bruce's team, particularly after losing Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo, Jonjo Shelvey and later Fabian Schar to injuries. 

Hamza Choudhury scored a late third for Leicester, bouncing back with two straight wins after defeats to closest rivals Manchester City and Liverpool.

Mourinho 'rude with an idiot'

Tottenham Hotspur missed a chance to close up on Chelsea in a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Southampton, with manager Jose Mourinho being cautioned after a second half altercation with a member of the home bench, goalkeeping coach Andrew Sparkes. 

"I was rude. But I was rude with an idiot. I clearly deserved the yellow card. I had bad words with the guy," a miffed Mourinho told BT Sport.

Danny Ings scored a fine individual goal for the Saints in the first half, his 13th in the league this season, and to add to Tottenham's woes striker Harry Kane limped off after scoring a goal disallowed for offside by VAR.

Southampton's fine form over the Christmas period has been matched by Watford under new manager Nigel Pearson, beating Wolves 2-1, with first-half goals from Gerard Deulofeu and Abdoulaye Doucoure setting up the victory.

Moyes wins first match

West Ham also gained a much-needed 4-0 home win over Bournemouth in David Moyes' first game in charge since his return to the London Stadium.

The emphatic defeat leaves the visitor in the relegation zone as two goals from captain Mark Noble lifted the Hammers.

He opened the scoring before Sebastien Haller emulated Jahanbakhsh earlier with a bicycle kick goal of his own.

Noble got the third from the penalty spot after being brought down by Harry Wilson, with Felipe Anderson completing the rout with his first of the season.

In the other evening kick offs, Gabriel Jesus scored twice as Manchester City inflicted a first defeat on new Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti in a 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium, to stay third, a point behind Leicester, while Norwich was held 1-1 by Crystal Palace to stay remain of the standings.
