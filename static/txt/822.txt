Liverpool continued its 100% start to the season with a resounding 3-0 victory Saturday away at Burnley to stay atop of the Premier League.

Two first-half goals -- an own goal from Chris Wood and the second from Sadio Mane -- put the game to bed, before Roberto Firmino added gloss to the scoreline with a third late on.

The win was Liverpool's 13th in a row in the league, the longest winning run in the club's history. The Reds are also the only team in England's top four leagues to have won every game so far this season.

Perhaps the only downside to Liverpool's afternoon was Mane's angry reaction after being substituted, with his frustration supposedly down to Mo Salah not passing him the ball during an attack.

However, manager Jurgen Klopp played down the incident.

"Everybody is happy -- Sadio is an emotional guy," Klopp told the BBC. "Would he do it exactly like this again? Probably not. I like this. He is completely fine and everything is good and we completely like each other."

Manchester City's 4-0 victory over Brighton earlier Saturday saw Pep Guardiola's side temporarily go top of the table thanks to a brace from Sergio Aguero and goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva.

In the day's early kick-off, Manchester United's struggles continued as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side could only manage a draw away to 10-man Southampton.

New signing Daniel James continued his fine individual form with his third goal in four games, firing a stunning first-half strike into the top corner.

But Southampton defender Jannik Vestergaard drew his side level with a header just before the hour mark and the home side managed to hold on for a point despite losing Kevin Danso to a red card on 73 minutes.

Meanwhile, Frank Lampard's rocky start to life in the Chelsea dugout continued as the Blues let a two-goal lead slip at home to newly-promoted Sheffield United.

Tammy Abraham gave Chelsea a 2-0 lead at half time, but Callum Robinson and a last-minute Kurt Zouma own goal earned the visitors a crucial point.
