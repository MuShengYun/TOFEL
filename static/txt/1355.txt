Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes led his side to a stunning fourth-quarter comeback to beat the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 in Super Bowl LIV.

US President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Mahomes' team on their win, though initially he had a few geographical problems.

 "Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game, and a fantastic comeback, under immense pressure," tweeted Trump. "You represented the Great State of Kansas and, in fact, the entire USA, so very well. Our Country is PROUD OF YOU!"

The Chiefs aren't from Kansas. They have always hailed from Kansas' neighboring state of Missouri.

Trump then deleted the tweet, re-posting a new one congratulating Missouri, though he wasn't quick enough for the keen-eyed on social media to point out his error.

In contrast, the 24-year-old Mahomes knew exactly what he was doing, though it took some cajoling to persuade his teammates.

Magic Mahomes

Trailing 20-10 in the fourth quarter, with 12 minutes on the clock, Mahomes had thrown his second interception of the game.

It seemed almost certain at that point that the Vince Lombardi trophy would be heading to San Francisco for a record-equaling sixth time.

But the Chiefs' quarterback had other ideas.

He drove his side on, and completed two touchdown passes to send the Chiefs charging into the lead. A rushing touchdown by Damien Williams took their tally to 31 and they sealed their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. 

It was an inspired revival, but Mahomes had already made a habit of dragging his team back from the brink in this year's NFL Playoffs.

Against the Texans in the Divisional Round, the Chiefs trailed 24-0 but went on to win 51-31.

In the AFC Championship, they trailed 17-7 but triumphed 35-24.

It seems Mahomes just has a knack for inspiring those around him to believe and play positively, just like him.

Wide receiver Tyreek Hill gave a glimpse into the boost Mahomes gives the team: "He was encouraging us, telling us to believe. You know, we were down 20-10 and he was telling us to believe in the fourth quarter. He (saw) it in some guys' eyes, they were getting down, including myself. I was like, 'Man, how are we going to pull this off?'

"And he was like, '(No.) 10 (Hill's jersey number), you've got to believe, brother. Like the same faith you've had all of your career, you've got to believe right now. It's going to happen, man. I can feel it.'"

Safety Daniel Sorensen said Mahomes' talent helps, too.

"We know that, as a defense, 'Look, get Pat the ball back and he can do things that are really special.' He can score in a hurry, and that's what we were able to do," said Sorensen.

Mahomes is the youngest quarterback ever to win both the Super Bowl and NFL MVP award, which he did last year as a 23-year-old.

He is also only the third African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Doug Williams (with Washington in Super Bowl XXII in 1988) and Russell Wilson (Seattle, Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014).

Speaking about this feat, Mahomes told CNN: "I think it just means, no matter where you come from, now matter how you were raised or what race you are, you can go out and follow your dreams. 

"That's what I've always believed. No one thought I was going to be a football player. 

"Everyone thought I was going to be a baseball player, but I followed my dreams and now I'm here, winning the Super Bowl with all my teammates."
