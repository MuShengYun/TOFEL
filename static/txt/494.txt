In the 99th minute, Jackie Groenen scored the only and winning goal, with her wonderful strike into the bottom-left corner, securing the Dutch a spot in Sunday's final against the Americans. 

Though the Netherlands is the reigning European Champion, the US women's national team may have seen little in this semifinal to concern them ahead of the title decider in the same stadium. 

For World Cup pedigree, the finalists are poles apart: three-time winner US is facing a team ranked eighth in the world, which is in its first final and competing in just its second World Cup.

But the Dutch are part of the European wave of traditional men's soccer powerhouses who have invested in women's football in recent years and the country's improvement has been exceptional. It is undoubtedly a talented team.

Indeed, the Dutch women are now on a 12-match winning streak in major tournaments after winning Euro 2017 and reaching the final in France, and as Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman told reporters: "It's one match and anything can happen."

The showdown between women's football's old and new powers will also be the second World Cup final to be contested by teams managed by female coaches, a significant feat considering only nine of the 24 teams which featured in this tournament were managed by women. 

"Women need to have the guts to make the choices and take risks to go for higher positions, but what we need to do as women is show that we have qualities," Wiegman said.

Whether it was the occasion -- both teams were attempting to reach the final for the first time, the sudorific conditions or, simply, two evenly-matched sides successfully negating each other's threats, neither team particularly sparkled.
