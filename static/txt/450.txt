The quarterfinals are upon us and the tournament's showpiece is little more than a week away. US captain Megan Rapinoe expects it to be a "wild and crazy" ride so strap in and enjoy the show. 

These are the teams still vying to get their hands on the trophy in Lyon on July 7 -- a record seven of which are European. 

Quarterfinal 1 -- Norway vs England (Thursday)

Norway reached the last eight after ousting Australia in a pulsating encounter that was eventually decided by penalties, and Martin Sj√∂gren's side proved unflappable, dispatching four spot kicks to Australia's one.

Without Ada Hegerberg, the world's best player who is abstaining from international duty over a disagreement with the country's football federation, Norway has battled hard through its first four matches, and to good effect. The group stages saw victories over South Korea and Nigeria and a narrow defeat to host France.

Caroline Graham Hansen has led the attack, while the country's all-time record goal scorer Isabell Herlovsen has found the net twice so far this tournament. 

Having crashed out of Euro 2017 with no points and no goals, Norway appears to have rediscovered its big tournament groove in France.

Next up, though, is England, Norway's conqueror in the round of 16 at the last World Cup. The Lionesses, nine places superior in the world rankings, are unbeaten so far this tournament and hungry to better the bronze medal they picked up in 2015.

It's been over 270 minutes since England conceded a goal, and in attack experienced striker Ellen White has put herself in contention for the golden boot, behind US' Alex Morgan. 

A heated round of 16 game against Cameroon had no shortage of controversy. England's opponent made clear its views on the video assistant referee's interference by staging on-field protests, while defenders Steph Houghton and Millie Bright are "major doubts" for the match. 

Houghton is battling to recover from an injury suffered towards the end of the last-16 game, while Bright has a bug which manager Phil Neville said was "going through the camp a little bit."

England is favorite to beat Norway in Le Havre on Thursday, but there's no let-up for whichever side prevails -- France or the US will lie waiting in the semifinals. 

Quarterfinal 2 -- USA vs France (Friday)

Of the four quarterfinal clashes in France, this is the pick of the bunch. 

The United States, the sole non-European representative left in the competition, breezed through the tournament's early stages, scoring goals and setting records for fun. But when Spain equalized against the defending champion nine minutes into their round of 16 match -- the first goal the US had conceded all tournament -- Jill Ellis's side looked rattled.

A further penalty from Megan Rapinoe, however, ensured that the world's top-ranked side progressed to the quarterfinals, as has been the case at every previous edition of the tournament. Never, in fact, has the US finished lower than third.
