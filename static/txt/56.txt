The magnitude 6.3 earthquake with a depth of 53.6 miles (83.3km) was registered on the island of Samar in central Philippines on Tuesday afternoon local time, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). There is no tsunami warning and no immediate reports of damage.

Tuesday's earthquake follows a large earthquake on Monday which struck near the town of Bodega on the Philippine island of Luzon on Monday, according to USGS.

The death toll from Monday's earthquake climbed to 11 on Tuesday, CNN Philippines reported. Around 30 people are still believed to be trapped after a supermarket collapsed in Porac, Pampanga, a province northwest of the capital Manila.

Authorities have put in place a state of calamity, which results in automatic price controls on necessities, and allows local government units to appropriate calamity funds, CNN Philippines reported.

Monday's earthquake

Monday's earthquake was felt in the capital of Manila as well as other parts of Luzon. CNN Philippines said that at least 52 aftershocks have been recorded.

Jaime Melo, president of the Clark International Airport Corporation, said seven people suffered minor injuries when part of the ceiling at the check-in lobby of a passenger terminal collapsed, according to the Philippine News Agency.

The Philippines' Department of Transportation earlier announced that operations at the airport would be suspended for 24 hours due to the damage. 

Local budget airline Cebu Pacific Air announced that it had canceled six flights scheduled for Monday evening as a pre-emptive measure. The airline said it would allow passengers on affected flights to get a full refund or re-route their flights via Manila.

In Manila, video emerged of water cascading from a penthouse swimming pool to the streets below as the quake shook the city. 

Skyscrapers swayed from the force of the quake, causing frightened office workers to flee the high-rise buildings in the capital. 

The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines is assessing the extent of damage on transmission lines in Luzon, which caused power outages in parts of the island, according to the Philippines News Agency.

Operations at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which serves Manila, are continuing normally, the Department of Transportation said.
