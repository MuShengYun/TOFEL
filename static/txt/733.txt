After winning the opening set in his three-set defeat by Russia's Karen Khachanov on Wednesday at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati, Kyrgios was hit with a time violation in the second set for taking too long between serves.

While seated between games, he exclaimed: "That's hilarious, if Rafa (Nadal) plays that quick I'm retiring from tennis. 

"Absolute rubbish ... disgrace. Get me some footage of Rafa playing that quick, that game. 

"If you can find any of that I'll shut my mouth and never speak again."

After Khachanov won the second set 7-6 (7-4), he called umpire Fergus Murphy "the worst f***ing ref ever, the worst ref in the game.

Walking off

Shortly after his outburst Kyrgios took a bathroom break which Murphy, citing not enough time remaining at the changeover, had refused him permission to take.

Having left the court with two rackets, cameras caught the world number 27 breaking them before making his way back to the court. 

After the defeat, Kyrgios called Murphy a "f***ing tool" and spat on the court in the chair umpire's direction before leaving. 

Kyrgios appears likely to be seeded for the US Open starting on August 26.
