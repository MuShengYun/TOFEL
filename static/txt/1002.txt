The win -- secured with seven tries including a brace from fly-half Johnny Sexton -- means Ireland currently top Pool A with 16 points, ahead of Japan's 14 and Scotland's 10. Japan and Scotland are due to meet in Yokohama on Sunday, though the game remains in doubt because of the devastating storm. 

Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday night local time as hurricane-force winds battered infrastructure and killed two people. Tokyo and nearby Yokohama are at the center of the storm. 

Weekend games between New Zealand and Italy as well as France and England had already been canceled Thursday, with Saturday's Formula One qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix also canceled. 

If Japan and Scotland are not able to play, the game will be declared a 0-0 draw with both teams receiving two points. Ireland would then play South Africa in the next round as group winners with Japan taking on New Zealand.

A resounding win

Not that Ireland were concerned with that for the 80 minutes against Samoa in Fukuoka, western Japan, some 1,100 kilometers away from Tokyo. Having already lost once in this tournament -- a 19-12 defeat to Japan that few saw coming -- coach Joe Schmidt's team would have been eager to lay down a marker ahead of the knockout phase.  

The first score came after just three minutes when captain and hooker Rory Best finished from the back of a driving maul.
