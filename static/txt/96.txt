It's the latest achievement for arguably the greatest marathon runner in history -- his time of two hours, two minutes and 37 seconds is the second fastest marathon of all time.

The rest of the field simply couldn't handle the pace as Kipchoge put his foot down at the halfway mark and then again with just over a mile left to run. 

His time was slightly off his own world record pace of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds -- which he set at the Berlin Marathon in 2018.

The marathon man remained tight-lipped when asked about when his fans would see him run again. 

"As usual, I do not chase two rabbits, I only chase one and that was London. I have caught that rabbit so I will discuss with my team what follows. The second option is still open," he told BBC after the race.

"The crowd in London is wonderful and that spirit pushed me. From the first kilometre to the last, everybody is shouting. I'm happy to cross the line."

Kosgei wins women's race

Meanwhile, Brigid Kosgei was the clear winner of the women's race after dominating the field with a phenomenal run. 

It is the Kenyan's first win in the London Marathon and she crossed the line over a minute ahead of second-placed defending champion Vivian Cheruiyot.

The 25-year-old's time of two hours, 18 minutes and 20 seconds highlighted an impressive second-half of the race after a slow start to the women's event.
