Britain will reportedly ban products made by Huawei from the "core" of next-generation 5G telecoms infrastructure. 

But the Chinese company will be allowed to help build less sensitive parts of the super-fast wireless network. The decision was first reported by The Telegraph.

The United States has heaped pressure on its allies to ban Huawei components from 5G networks due to security concerns. The Trump administration alleges that Huawei products could be used by China for spying.

Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations. 

A UK government spokesperson would not confirm reports that May had settled on a plan to address the issue.

"National Security Council discussions are confidential," the spokesperson said. "Decisions from those meetings are made and announced at the appropriate time through the established processes."

"The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance," the spokesperson added. 

Huawei said in a statement that it "welcomes reports" that the UK government would allow it to participate in building 5G networks. 

"This green light means that UK businesses and consumers will have access to the fastest and most reliable networks thanks to Huawei's cutting edge technology," a spokesperson said in a statement. 

The compromise approach won't leave everyone happy, however. 

Tom Tugendhat, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the arrangement, which he said would cause allies to question whether Britain could keep data secure and erode trust in intelligence sharing.

"There's a reason others have said no," he said on Twitter.
