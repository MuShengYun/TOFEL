"Our beloved squad member Jose Antonio Reyes died in a traffic accident," the club said.

Reyes made a name for himself playing for Sevilla, where he began his career as a young player in their football academy. Reyes made his professional debut for the club in 2000, at the age of 16.

The Spaniard would eventually move to a string of top-flight clubs around Europe, including Arsenal, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

Arsenal tweeted that everyone at the club was "devastated" by the news, saying Reyes was "a hugely popular figure at our club," who would "always hold a special place in our hearts."

Thierry Henry, who played alongside him at Arsenal, paid tribute to Reyes as a "wonderful player, superb team mate and exceptional human being," and offered his condolences to the footballer's family and friends.

Reyes was also a Spanish international, having earned 21 caps for his country, and represented his nation at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.

Spain's football federation expressed their condolences on Twitter.

The 35-year-old footballer also played for Benfica in Portugal, before making a return to Sevilla in 2011. His last first division team in Spain was Espanyol, where he played for one season in 2016.

The club also tweeted out their support.

"From RCD Espanyol we wish to express our heartfelt condolences and send all our support to the family and to those at Sevilla", the club said.
