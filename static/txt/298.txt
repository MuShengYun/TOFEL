Lauda passed away at the age of 70 on May 21. He was hospitalized with influenza earlier this year and underwent a lung transplant in August 2018.

The Austrian, who won F1 titles in 1975, 1977 and 1984, is best remembered for his recovery from a life-threatening crash at the German Grand Prix in 1976. 

He inhaled toxic fumes and suffered horrific burns after his car collided with a barrier and burst into flames, but returned to racing just six weeks later. Two of his three world titles were won after the crash.
