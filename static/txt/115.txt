This year's winners of the men's and women's singles competitions will pick up $3.06 million (£2.35 million) each as part of an 11.8 percent increase in the overall pot from $44.2 million (£34m) to $49.4 million (£38m).

Even losing qualifiers or losers in the first three rounds will benefit from a $13,000 (£10,000) raise to their cheques.

Last year, champions Novak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber pocketed $2.93 million (£2.25m) for winning the tournament.

The US Open remains tennis' richest payday, with Flushing Meadows handing out $3.89 million (£2.99m) to the singles champions.

The Wimbledon organizer also announced that the new retractable roof on Court One -- the venue's second biggest arena -- will be ready for the 2019 championships.

The All England Club (AELTC) chairman Philip Brook, whose time in charge of the club will come to a conclusion at the end of 2019, spoke of his pride at the continuing growth of the year's third major tournament, highlighting the purchase of land at the adjacent Wimbledon Park Golf Club, which represents a vital aspect of Wimbledon's redevelopment and expansion plans.

"The investment we have made in our estate, in the grass court season, in facilities for all of our guests both onsite and around the world, in prize money, in the surplus to the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), and in our staff, has resulted in strong foundations for the future of the Championships and of our sport as we plan for a new period of leadership," he said in a statement.

Last month, the AELTC announced an increase in the cost of the club's exclusive five-year debenture tickets, with the passes going on sale for $105,000 (£80,000).

As well as granting admission to every Centre Court game between 2021 and 2025, the debenture also potentially offers an unusual investment opportunity. One such case in February saw a pass-holder buy a five-year debenture for $66,149, before selling the final two years of the premium ticket for $138,892 three years later.
