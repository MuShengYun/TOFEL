The Brazil international will now miss the first three games of next season's Champions League group stage.

Neymar was incensed that a last minute penalty was awarded to United using the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system.

Referee Damir Skomina adjudged that PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe had handled a shot from United's Diogo Dalot in the closing stages of the last 16 Champions League tie.

Marcus Rashford scored the resulting penalty, sending PSG crashing out of the competition. 

Neymar missed the the match through injury but was in attendance at the Parc des Princes.

"This is a disgrace, they put four people who know nothing about football in charge of looking at the replay for VAR," Neymar wrote. 

"It's just not possible!!! How is a guy going to hold his hand behind his back" he asked, referring to how Kimpembe jumped as he tried to block Dalot's shot. "Go f**k yourselves."

Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, has only just returned to the PSG lineup after a lengthy spell on the sidelines due to a metatarsal injury.

PSG will qualify automatically for the group stage of next season's Champions League after securing a second consecutive French title last weekend.

Montenegro punished for racist chanting

UEFA also announced on Friday that Montenegro would play its next home match behind closed doors after England players suffered racist abuse while playing in European Championship qualifier in Podgorica last month.

England won the match 5-1 but the victory was soured by racist chants reportedly aimed at a number of players from the crowd. Monkey noises also appeared to be directed at England defender Danny Rose in the game's closing stages.

Rose later said he couldn't wait to see the back of football due to the lack of action against racist fan behavior by football's governing bodies.

Montenegro's next scheduled home fixture is against Kosovo on June 7.
