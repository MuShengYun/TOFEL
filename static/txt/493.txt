The 41-year-old will replace Italian boss Murauzzio Sarri, who left to take charge of Serie A champion Juventus last month. 

Considered one of the greatest players to have ever played at Stamford Bridge, Lampard left the Blues in 2014 having won three English Premier League titles during 13 years at the club.

"I am immensely proud to be returning to Chelsea as head coach," said Lampard, who made 648 appearances.

"Everyone knows my love for this club and the history we have shared. However, my sole focus is on the job in hand and preparing for the season ahead.

"I am here to work hard, bring further success to the club and I cannot wait to get started."

Chelsea launched an appeal to Switzerland's Court of Arbitration for Sport over the transfer ban.

To make matters worse, the Blues also lost star player Eden Hazard to Real Madrid earlier in the window.
