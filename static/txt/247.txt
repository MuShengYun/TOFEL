Robben and Ribery have been at the club for 10 years and 12 years, respectively, winning numerous domestic titles and the Champions League in 2013.

Though most Bundesliga campaigns in recent years have been foregone conclusions, this season was much different.

Bayern was pushed all the way to the final game by Borussia Dortmund, which at one stage held a nine-point lead over its rival at the top of the table.

Dortmund had to beat Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach and hope that Frankfurt could beat Bayern for it to have any chance of lifting a first league title since 2012.

Dortmund held up its end of the deal, winning 2-0, and for all of three minutes thought Frankfurt might do the same.

Sebastian Haller's 50th-minute strike canceled out Kingley Coman's early opener to give Dortmund a glimmer of hope some 640 kilometers away.

But less than 180 seconds later, David Alaba restored Bayern's lead before Renato Sanches made it three five minutes later.

It was then time for Robben and Ribery -- affectionately dubbed 'Robbery' -- to enter the Allianz Arena pitch for one last time, replacing their protegees Coman and Serge Gnabry.

Ribery got in on the action first, deftly lifting the ball over goalkeeper Kevin Trapp after some delightful trademark quick feet, before Robben scored Bayern's fifth and final goal with a simple tap in.

Such was Ribery's delight at scoring, he even gave the referee a hug despite being booked for taking his shirt off to celebrate.
