The 2003 champions are among the favorites to lift this year's trophy and started on the front foot as Tonga's defense was made to work tirelessly to keep them out. 

Despite its best efforts, the deadlock was broken shortly after 10 minutes with England's Owen Farrell kicking a penalty, a simple one by his lofty standards. 

However, Tonga proved it can compete with any team in the world on a physical level, after a crunching tackle on England's Billy Vunipola heated up the affair. The almighty hit seemed to inspire the underdogs who equaled the score with a penalty of their own shortly after.

The revival was short lived though, as England took control of the encounter when Manu Tuilagi powered over the line to score the game's first try.

The 28-year-old was in inspired form on Sunday and registered his second score of the match to put England in complete control by half-time. 

Farrel fired over another penalty shortly after the restart, before Jamie George and Luke-Cowan Dickie charged over the line to put the game to bed.

Despite the bonus-point victory, England began to lack quality as the game wore on with a number of handling errors perhaps giving head coach Eddie Jones pause for thought.
