The 13-0 scoreline was a true reflection of the match. It was a thumping, and it was a night that records tumbled as Thailand suffered the heaviest defeat in World Cup history.

As both teams walked out onto the field for their opening match of the Women's World Cup, the difference in the physical statures of the opposing players was startlingly apparent. Not long after the final notes of the national anthems had faded into the ether so the disparity in quality became obvious, too.

Ominous warning

It took just 12 minutes for the defending champions to open the scoring, Alex Morgan heading home from four yards. That only Rose Lavelle, who would end the night with two goals, and Lindsey Horan had added to the scoreline by halftime was the real surprise.

After the break, the goals quickly came -- four in the space of six minutes, raising the decibels inside Stade Auguste-Delaune, a stadium in France's champagne region which had become a pocket of America for the evening.
