The Scots are due to face Japan in Yokohama Sunday in a game they must win to have a chance of progressing to the knockout stages, but the match could be called off for safety reasons.

Under World Cup rules, there is no provision for a postponement and the result would go down as a 0-0 draw with both team awarded two points, meaning Scotland would likely be eliminated.

"For World Rugby to just simply state that the game has to be canceled goes against the whole sporting integrity of the tournament," said Scotland Rugby Union (SRU) chief executive Mark Dodson, talking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme Friday. 

"We've had legal opinion that challenges World Rugby's interpretation."

Japan is top of Pool A on 14 points with world No.1 Ireland, which takes on Samoa Saturday, in second on 11 points and Scotland third on 10. 

With hopes hanging by a thread, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend has pleaded with organizers to ensure the game goes ahead.

"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played," Townsend told reporters Thursday.
