The French powerhouse hammered first-time finalist Barcelona 4-1 in Budapest, with inaugural Women's Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg netting a hat-trick inside the opening half an hour.

There were just 16 minutes and 12 seconds between the Norwegian's first and third goals as Barcelona had no answer to her superior movement and finishing.

Lyon has exerted its dominance on the Women's Champions League over the past decade, reaching the final in eight of the past 10 seasons and victory against Barcelona is a record-extending sixth title.

Barcelona got off to the worst possible start, as Germany captain Dzsenifer Marozsán gave Lyon the lead inside five minutes before Hegerberg made it 4-0 before half time.

Barcelona, to its credit, continued to pass and press and should have clawed one goal back on the stroke of half time. Alexia Putellas crept in unmarked at the far post but could only plant her header onto the crossbar.

The second half was a much more even affair and Barcelona could have again reduced the deficit after the hour mark. 

Dutch forward Lieke Martens -- voted The FIFA Best player in 2017 -- found herself in space inside the box but could only skew her effort wide of the post.

Barcelona did eventually get the goal its second half efforts deserved, as substitute Asisat Oshoala got on the end of Marten's threaded pass and slotted the ball under Sarah Bouhaddi.

It proved to be little more than a consolation and Lyon hasn't suffered defeat in the Champions League since losing to Manchester City in 2017 -- and even then it won the tie on aggregate.

It's going to take something quite special to knock this dominant force in women's football off its perch.
