Speaking to reporters Thursday, Negeri Sembilan state police chief Mohamad Mat Yusop said a post-mortem showed no evidence that Quoirin had been abducted or raped.

"There were some abrasion and bruises on her leg but they were not likely to have led to her death," said Yusop. 

"The main reason for her death is intestinal damage, the intestine was punctured, which could be due to starvation for a long period of time and could also be due to prolonged stress."

Quoirin, who disappeared from the Dusun resort on August 4, had died two or three days before her body was found Tuesday, according to investigators.

Her family described Quoirin as "especially vulnerable" due to "learning and developmental disabilities."

"Nora would not know how to get help and would never leave her family voluntarily," her aunt wrote in a crowd funding appeal to help find the teenager.

The teenager was born with holoprosencephaly, a rare disorder affecting the brain's development. It affects communication and writing abilities, as well as balance and coordination.
