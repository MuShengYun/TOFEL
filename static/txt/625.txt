In a week that Shane Lowry won the British Open at Portrush and Ireland's cricketers embarrassed England at Lord's, Adare Manor was chosen as the venue for one of golf's biggest showpiece events.

Not since 2006 has Ireland hosted the event, an occasion where Europe claimed a record third consecutive triumph with a crushing victory at County Kildare.

The news will be of great interest to local business with over 270,000 people having watched Europe's victory over the US at last September's event at France's Le Golf National near Versailles.
