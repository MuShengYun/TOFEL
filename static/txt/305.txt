Make that rallied again. 

For the second straight match the Japanese world No. 1 escaped from a set and break down to continue her passage at the clay-court grand slam. 

This time it came against former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who led 6-4 4-2 before Osaka turned things around for a 4-6 7-5 6-3 second-round victory that extended her grand slam winning streak to 16. 

The much-hyped affair in still grey Paris lived up to its billing, captivating the audience on Suzanne Lenglen for nearly three hours.

On Tuesday there was a reprieve for the 21-year-old when Anna Karolina Schmiedlova couldn't serve out the contest at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second set. 

That third set went quickly and it appeared the same would happen Thursday as Osaka raced to a 5-1 advantage. The Belarusian however clawed back to 5-3 prior to Osaka sealing proceedings when a return sailed long. 

Moments earlier, Azarenka -- a two-time grand slam champion like Osaka -- flung her racket in disgust as the match slipped from her grasp. 

She lost her ninth straight tussle versus top-10 opposition at a grand slam.
