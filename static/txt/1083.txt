Throughout protests in Central this week, bankers, lawyers and other white collar works have taken their lunch breaks at the front lines, wearing masks and holding umbrellas. In some ways, this was reminiscent of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when the protest camps became mini tourist attractions -- but those coming out in Central weren't simply rubbernecking, they helped build barricades and transport equipment to those on the front. 

They also paid the cost: a Citi banker was reportedly arrested after a dispute with police Wednesday, and other white-collar workers appeared to be among those detained during and after clashes in Central all week. 

While there are undoubtedly material causes behind the unrest -- not least the extortionate cost of housing -- the involvement of well-paid white-collar workers is the latest sign of just how badly the government has misread, or willfully ignored, the depth of antipathy towards it, even as the protests themselves become more violent and disruptive. 

 

For months now, Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her administration have insisted that support for the protests is waning. The narrative goes that while there was widespread support for withdrawing the extradition bill that started this crisis -- as evidenced by multiple large-scale marches that brought the city to a standstill -- ordinary Hong Kongers do not approve of the growing violence and vandalism, and want to see a return to normality. This has justified Lam's hardline policy, which has relied on the police and emergency powers to stem the unrest. 

Of course, many Hong Kongers are frustrated by the constant disruption, and worried and sickened by the violence. The incredibly heightened political environment in the city may also be causing some critics to stay silent, for fear of losing friends or family members.

But the evidence that any kind of major shift is happening remains scant, and if there is indeed a silent majority, most of them are just that, silent. 

The widespread protests this week, which saw large numbers of bystanders joining in, in both Central and other parts of the city, came after one of the most shocking acts of violence by protesters so far: the dousing of a man in flammable liquid and setting him alight. The incident was caught on camera and shared widely, but while it sparked condemnation and disgust, it does not seem to have sapped support. 

Other incidents of violence -- including the death this week of an elderly man police say was hit by a brick -- or mass destruction have similarly not had the effect on public opinion that might be expected, nor has the fact that the city's economy is reeling, plunging into recession for the first time in a decade.
