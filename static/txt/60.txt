Players wore shirts with an outline of the cathedral in place of the regular sponsor and their names were replaced by 'Notre Dame,' while fans held a banner aloft before kick-off.

A catastrophic fire engulfed Notre Dame on April 15, destroying the 850-year-old cathedral's iconic spire and roof.

PSG had been confirmed as champion of France for the eighth time several hours before its clash against Monaco, after second place Lille failed to beat Toulouse.

The match marked a return to the first team for $263 million signing Neymar, who had been out with a metatarsal injury since January, but the Brazilian was outshone by Kylian Mbappe in a 3-1 win.

The 20-year-old scored all three of PSG's goals, before Aleksandr Golovin got a late consolation for the visiting side.

After the game, coach Thomas Tuchel confirmed Mbappe would remain at the club despite speculation surrounding a possible transfer to Real Madrid.

"The president [Nasser Al-Khelaifi] has always told me the same thing: There are no opportunities for other clubs to buy Kylian this summer," the German told his press conference.

"I've always been convinced that he'll always be our player. This is important to achieve all our objectives. To win, we need players like Kylian.

"We need to have Kylian on the team. He's a decisive player for us, he can improve, he shows it every week, every three days. There's nothing else to say about Kylian, I've already said everything.

"If we play for PSG, everyone expects us to win and we expect that from us, too. For that, we need the best players like Kylian in attack. If he plays, everyone is confident of scoring anytime."
