Two-time grand slam champion Osaka, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Haitian father but was brought up in the US, told NHK that it gives her "a special feeling to try to go to the Olympics to represent Japan."

 

According to Japanese law, those with dual nationality must chose one before turning 22 years old. Osaka's 22nd birthday is on October 16.

"I think I will be able to put more of my emotion into it by playing for the pride of the country," she told NHK.
