Not since the all-conquering Arsenal Ladies team of 2007 has a team won the FA Cup, League Cup and Premier League title.

First half goals from David Silva and Gabriel Jesus -- although there was some debate as to whether Raheem Sterling got the final touch -- gave City a deserved lead at the break, though it wasn't all plain sailing.

Roberto Pereyra had a glorious chance to give Watford the lead early on but was unable to find a way past Ederson to finish off a scintillating counter attack.

It proved to be the wake-up call City needed and it didn't once look like relinquishing the lead after Silva opened the scoring just a few minutes later.

As Watford pressed and probed for a way back into the game in the second half, it left itself exposed on the break.

Kevin De Bruyne ended the final as a contest on the hour mark, receiving the ball from Jesus before showing remarkable composure to round Heurelho Gomes and slot into an empty net.

City got a fourth soon after through Jesus and now had more history in its sights. Only twice in FA Cup final history has a team scored more than four goals -- Bury in 1903 and Blackburn in 1890.

It would soon equal Bury's all-time record for biggest FA Cup final victory, as Sterling scored two quickfire goals inside the last 10 minutes to make it 6-0.

Though it was a painful day for everyone involved at Watford, its fans never stopped supporting their team. But by the time the sixth goal went in, even Pep Guardiola was looking somewhat embarrassed by the score.

Sterling, who grew up on an estate in the shadow of Wembley as it was being built, said winning the FA Cup at the stadium he used to cycle past was a "dream come true."

His captain, Vincent Kompany, praised Guardiola for the relentless intensity he instills in this talented squad every year.

"It starts with the manager, who set the standard at the start of the season," he told BT Sport. "It's a positive group with young players, talented.

"As soon as we scored the two goals and they had to come and press, it opened the game up. It wasn't as easy as the score says, but what a season and what a tremendous club."
