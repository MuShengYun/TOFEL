On Tuesday, hundreds of black-clad protesters, many of them students, attempted to block riot police from entering the prestigious and largely isolated Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) near Tai Po. Under a barrage of constant tear gas, protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police. 

Smoke could be seen across parts of the New Territories, as protesters built massive bonfires from barricades and an abandoned car. The fierce confrontation continued well into the early hours, as police kept threatening a clearance of the campus. As of Wednesday mid-morning, several thousand students were on campus, many armed with petrol bombs, bows, and other impromptu weapons, as more supplies were brought to campus by car and on foot. 

Also on Wednesday, police attempted to clear barricades in Kowloon Tong, and local residents and government workers cleared up debris and barricades in Mong Kok, where clashes between police and protesters -- which saw numerous rounds of tear gas fired in the heavily built up area -- lasted until around 3 a.m. 

The eruption of violence at CUHK follows some of the worst unrest seen in the semi-autonomous Chinese city since anti-government protests began nearly five months ago, with police describing the situation as on the "brink of a total breakdown."

Unrest is expected to continue, with CUHK as the main focus, as protesters on campus arm themselves with with unconventional weapons including bows and arrows and javelins. Attention in the city has been focused on the campus, and dramatic pictures coming out of it overnight largely replaced those from earlier this week on front pages and social media, including the shooting of a protester by a police officer and the setting on fire of a man following a dispute with protesters Monday. 

Campus under 'siege'

In one of the densest cities in the world, CUHK is a world apart. Its sprawling campus sits in the hills of city's New Territories, accessed only by a handful of roads and one train station, which, combined with the fact that many students live on site, give it a self-contained, small town-like feel.
