She has been caught up in a war of words with US President Donald Trump and scored two goals against host France to lead her side to the semifinals of the Women's World Cup.

Then after the game, Rapinoe, according to several outlets including the Guardian in the UK, proclaimed: "Go gays. You can't win a championship without gays on your team. It's never been done before, ever. That's science, right there."

According to the newspaper, Rapinoe was responding to whether starring for the US during Pride month was extra special. 

"I'm motivated by people who like me, who are fighting for the same things," she continued. "I take more energy from that than from trying to prove anyone wrong. That's draining on yourself. But for me, to be gay and fabulous during Pride month at the World Cup is nice."

Her two goals helped eliminate France in what was the most anticipated match of this year's tournament and US head coach Jill Ellis used her post-match press conference to heap praise on her co-captain.

"It's almost as if it feeds her, she's a big personality both on and off the pitch and I think she honestly thrives in these moments," Ellis told reporters.

"There's a never-say-die attitude, she loves and lives for those moments. She's a big-time player and the bigger the stage the more she's going to respond and I think she was fantastic tonight."

The US made a blistering start on a warm evening in Paris with Rapinoe taking less than five minutes to score her first goal.

A constant thorn in the side of France, the 33-year-old continued to look threatening and was well worth her brace. 

The passionate celebration which followed her second goal was perhaps a release from a turbulent couple of days. 

"That was everything you want," smiled the Player of the Match.

"That was such a big performance by our group. The focus defensively, the willingness and the discipline was tremendous. We were ruthless in our chances. It was a game we'll never forget here in Paris."

However, the defending champion was made to work hard for its win. 

Cheered on by a raucous home crowd, France overcame a shaky start to make a real game of it and might have felt unfortunate not to have been awarded a penalty in the closing stages.
