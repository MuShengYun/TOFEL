Hundreds of protesters blocked security gates at one of the world's largest travel hubs on Tuesday, with some passengers struggling to get through the demonstrators to their gates.

At 5 p.m. Hong Kong's Airport Authority announced that all check-in services would be suspended for another night, due to terminal operations being "seriously disrupted."

"Members of the public are advised not to come to the airport," the authority said in a statement. All outbound flights which have not yet completed the check-in process have been canceled.

Inbound flights will continue to operate as scheduled.

It followed a night of chaos at the airport Monday when dozens of outgoing flights were canceled after thousands of protesters arrived to protest police violence during protests on Sunday.

Many passengers were left stranded with little information as to their situation with some even spending the night in the airport on the chance they would get a flight out.

On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam warned that the city was on "the brink of no return" and said it would take a long time to recover from the recent mass demonstrations.

"The only thing we have to do is to go against violence, and rebuild the city," said Lam.

In an unusually strong statement, Hong Kong company Swire Pacific, who own flagship airline Cathay Pacific, have called for the "restoration of law and order" in the city.

"We must act now to stop the violence and preserve the stability, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong," the statement said.

World transport hub grounded

Last year, Hong Kong's airport handled 74.7 million passengers -- an average of about 205,000 per day. But on Monday, the airport was brought to a standstill as protesters occupied parts of the airport.

Confused tourists were left unsure of what was happening as shops, restaurants and check-in counters closed. Trains and buses heading into the city were packed with people, and the one available information desk was staffed by frazzled looking workers.

After the numbers of protesters dwindled overnight, more began to pour into the airport from early on Tuesday morning, chanting slogans and putting up signs.
